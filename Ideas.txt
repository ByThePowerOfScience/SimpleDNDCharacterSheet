Probably use it as a backdrop too, just for flavor

For stats:
	* An (i) icon that when hovered over will show what is affecting it
	 	- Example:
	 		AC: 17
	 			+10 base
	 			+4 Wisdom Modifier (Unarmored Defense)
	 			+3 Dexterity Modifier
	* Each stat will have temporary modifiers as a LIST not as one box
		- Temporary modifiers will be as such:
			"Name":
				list of stats it affects and what should be added
		- create Template temporary modifiers like for Bless or Bardic Inspiration that can be applied or even shared?
		- Rasterize it into a button toggle so you can turn it off easier, or situationally
			- if you're reading this: YES i know that's not what rasterize means but ever since I saw "Rasterize Layer" in photoshop I can't stop thinking of it as meaning "turn something into another something abstractly or representationally" so anyway *I* KNOW WHAT I MEAN
		- Combine list of temporary effects into just one list?
		- Turn stat number color green if it's being boosted by a temporary effect
		- Maybe have modifiers be either classified as passive, temporary, or situational?
	* Anything that's calculated should be able to be manually overridden in case there's a mechanic I didn't think about

Save stats as JSON, export/import
	-Also save in cache locally if I can figure that out
